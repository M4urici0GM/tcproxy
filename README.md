# Tcproxy

Project name is a tool that allows port forwarding to your local machine, even behind firewall.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Rust 1.67 or later

## How it works
The project is split into two parts, the server, and a client, whenever a new client
connects to the server, the server spawns a new listening port, in which all traffic 
will be routed to the client.
The server uses a single TCP connection, multiplexing all traffic being forwarded to 
the connected client.

The following diagram shows a local TCP server (REST api, local db instance, etc..)
that receives forwarded traffic from the remote (random) port on the server

## Using Tcproxy Server

To spawn  ```tcproxy-server```, follow these steps:

To see all options:
```
$ tcproxy-server --help
```

Starting the server listening on port 8080

```
$ tcproxy --port 8080
```

Starting the server with a different port range available for proxy servers (default is from 15000-25000)
```
$ tcproxy --port 8080
```

## Using Tcproxy Client (cli)

To see all options:
```
$ tcproxy-cli --help
```

Starting to receive remote connections:
```
$ tcproxy-cli listen <local-port>
```

Starting to receive remote connections using an app context:
```
$ tcproxy-cli listen <local-port> --app-context <name>
```

### App Contexts
Contexts are like origins on git, you can have multiple ones, and when starting to listen,
you can specify to where tcproxy-cli is going to connect. By default tcproxy-cli doesnt
contain any app context, and when you create the first one, it is set as the default.

Listing all your available contexts:
```
$ tcproxy-cli context list
```

Creating new context
```
$ tcproxy-cli context create <name> <ip>:<port>
```

Setting an existing context as default:
```
$ tcproxy-cli context set-default <name>
```

## Running it locally (dev environment)
1. Fork the repository
2. Start the server with ```cargo run --bin tcproxy-server -- --port 8080```
3. In another terminal, create a new app context with ```cargo run --bin tcproxy-cli -- context create main 127.0.0.1:8080```
4. Then Start the client with ```cargo run --bin tcproxy-cli -- listen 3337```
