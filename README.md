## Open source Reverse-proxy

This idea came out when i needed to expose some apps on the internet, but running them on my machine (like showing to my friends, for instance),
and when researching for options, i've came across [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), but with free account you can only expose single port,
which wasnt enough for me at the time, so ive decided to write my own similar software as an open source solution.
