# Tcproxy

Project name is a tool that allows port forwarding to your local machine, even behind firewall.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Rust 1.67 or later

## How it works
The project is split into two parts, the server, and a client, whenever a new client
connects to the server, the server spawns a new listening port, in which all traffic 
will be routed to the client.
The server uses a single TCP connection, multiplexing all traffic being forwarded to 
the connected client.

The following diagram shows a local TCP server (REST api, local db instance, etc..)
that receives forwarded traffic from the remote (random) port on the server

## Using Tcproxy Server

To spawn  ```tcproxy-server```, follow these steps:

To see all options:
```
> tcproxy-server --help

With Cargo:
> cargo run --bin tcproxy-server -- --help
```

Starting the server listening on port 8080

```
> tcproxy --port 8080

With Cargo:
> cargo run --bin tcproxy-server -- --port 8080
```

Starting the server with a different port range available for proxy servers (default is from 15000-25000)
```
> tcproxy --port 8080

With Cargo:
> cargo run --bin tcproxy-server -- --port 8080
```
